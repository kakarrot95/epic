    "# Data Science Final Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dear Students,<br><br>Welcome to your final exam in data science. Remember that the true essence of data science lies not only in obtaining results but in extracting meaningful insights.<br><br>In this examination we encourage you to focus not just on the output your code generates but on the story it tells. Sometimes, peculiar outcomes can act as beacons, signaling potential issues in your code or data. Rather than dismissing them, consider these anomalies as opportunities to refine your analysis and enhance your problem-solving skills.<br><br>As you progress through the tasks, think of your comments as a roadmap for others to follow your analytical journey. Clearly articulate your intentions before executing code, detail the steps you took, and, most importantly, provide a comprehensive interpretation of your results. A well-documented analysis not only showcases your technical proficiency but also your ability to think critically about the data at hand.<br><br>Remember, data science is not merely about crunching numbers; it's about crafting narratives that guide decision-making. Each line of code you write and every graph you create contributes to a broader story. Make sure your commentary reflects this understanding, and don't hesitate to acknowledge any challenges or uncertainties you encounter along the way.<br><br>Best of luck!"
